## What is this?

"Salle de Cons" translates roughly to "room of fools". It is a salon-style gathering to share arts and ideas, find creative collaborators, and generally engage in entertaining conversation and shenanigans. 

The name is inspired by:

1. Its phonological resemblance to the French pronunciation of [salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)): "a gathering of people held by an inspiring host."
2. The French play and film, [Le DÃ®ner de Cons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_D%C3%AEner_de_Cons#Title) -- but we won't be secretly making fun of any one fool like they do in that story.  Instead, we embrace that we are all fools and want to encourage each other's foolishness and genius.

## Logistics

Each salon has:
* **Host**: provides the space for the evening. Sets the number of attendees who are able to attend based on the constraints of the space. May also set limits on the types of activities allowed, and communicate those limits to the master con artist.
* **Master con artist**: solicits presenters and sets the "lineup" for the structured part of the gathering. Ensures the planned activities are okay with the host, and acts as emcee during the "event".  This person has the most prep work to do ahead of time and during the event, so they get to wear a special foolish hat.
* **Provider of food**: someone who ensures there is fancy cheese to be eaten by anyone who agrees to put their phone in a box for the duration of the "event".  Or just bring any snack.  But there should be fancy luddite cheese.
* **Provider of beverage**: someone who ensures there are things to drink. Ideally there should be one alcoholic beverage per person and a non-alcoholic option.  Beyond that, fools must BYOB.
